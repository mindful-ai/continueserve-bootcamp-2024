To list all tables in an Oracle database, you can query the data dictionary 
views provided by Oracle. The most commonly used views for this purpose 
are ALL_TABLES, USER_TABLES, and DBA_TABLES. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:

ALL_TABLES: Shows all tables accessible to the current user.
USER_TABLES: Shows all tables owned by the current user.
DBA_TABLES: Shows all tables in the database. This view requires DBA privileges.

SELECT table_name
FROM all_tables;

PS: try with user_tables, dba_tables


To list the tables owned by the current user:

SELECT owner, table_name
FROM dba_tables
ORDER BY owner, table_name;

To see all the PDBs:

SQL> select name from v$pdbs;

To see the current user:

SQL> select user from dual;

To check the service name:

SQL> select sys_context('userenv', 'service_name') from dual;

To check of available services:

SQL> select name from V$SERVICES;
SQL> select name from V$ACTIVE_SERVICES;

2. Sorting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Ordering in ascending order:

SELECT
    name,
    address,
    credit_limit
FROM
    customers
ORDER BY
    name ASC;

--- Sorting multiple rows:

SELECT
	first_name,
	last_name
FROM
	contacts
ORDER BY
	first_name,
	last_name DESC;

--- Specifying positions of the columns:

SELECT
    name,
    credit_limit
FROM
    customers
ORDER BY
    2 DESC,
    1;

--- With NULLs:

SELECT
    country_id,
    city,
    state
FROM
    locations
ORDER BY
    state ASC NULLS FIRST;

--- Using functions:

SELECT
	customer_id,
	name
FROM
	customers
ORDER BY
	UPPER( name );

--- Order the date column:

SELECT 
   order_id, 
   customer_id, 
   status, 
   order_date
FROM 
   orders
ORDER BY 
   order_date DESC;
