Write a program to extract the spans of the given substring in a text
Span is the starting index and ending index represented as tuple

Example:

text <- 'mississippi'
substring <- ss

Output:

[(2, 4), (5, 7)]

This means that ss in the python indeces [2:4] and [5:7] of the string "mississippi"

Test:

>>> s = "mississippi"
>>> s[2:4]
ss
>>> s[5:7]
ss
