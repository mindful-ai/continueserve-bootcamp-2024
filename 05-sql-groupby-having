4. GROUPBY / HAVING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT
    status
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    status;

SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT( order_id )
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    customer_id
ORDER BY
    customer_id;

SELECT
    name,
    COUNT( order_id )
FROM
    orders
INNER JOIN customers
        USING(customer_id)
GROUP BY
    name
ORDER BY
    name;

SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) YEAR,
    COUNT( order_id )
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)
ORDER BY
    YEAR;

The following statement computes the sales amount and groups them by customer_id, status, and (customer_id, status)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    status,
    SUM( quantity * unit_price ) sales
FROM
    orders
INNER JOIN order_items
        USING(order_id)
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP(
        customer_id,
        status
    );

---------------- HAVING

In this statement, the HAVING clause appears immediately after the GROUP BY clause.

If you use the HAVING clause without the GROUP BY clause, the HAVING clause works like the WHERE clause.

SELECT
    order_id,
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) order_value
FROM
    order_items
GROUP BY
    order_id
HAVING
    SUM( unit_price * quantity ) > 1000000
ORDER BY
    order_value DESC;
